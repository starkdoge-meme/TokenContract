# starknet-erc20-lazy-initialization
## ü™Ç Description
Open now your wallet on ~~Goerli~~ Mainnet and add this token:  
**0x07fE495Ecc5549978c73fF9b544B0c6CE84AeB60405AcDeb9Befc603C80dA0e0**.  

Deploy a new wallet and add the token again... 

  
This is the biggest airdrop ever. 
I didn't run a computer to send this token to every possible address I just modifid the default implementation of an ERC20 contract to make it lazy initialized.  
Note that it could also be used as a testnet (or even mainnet) token to avoid user to have to mint the tokens.  
[Link to the deployed contract](https://starkscan.co/contract/0x07fE495Ecc5549978c73fF9b544B0c6CE84AeB60405AcDeb9Befc603C80dA0e0)  

## ü§î But how?
First I started by copying [the default ERC20 of OpenZeppelin (at this date)](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts/blob/cairo-1/src/openzeppelin/token/erc20.cairo). Then I just had to adapt two methods.  

### ‚öñÔ∏è balanceOf
Because this is the entry point of an ERC20 to read the balance of a user (how unexpected, right?), this is where we have to make our first little modification.  

 
### üì§ _transfer

This is the same as written by OpenZeppelin with some adjustemnts:  
 1. Checking that the UINT256 is valid (no modification)
 2. Checking that the sender is valid (no modification)
 3. Checking that the receiver is valid (no modification)
